defmodule Glock do
  @moduledoc """
  Glock is a simple websocket client application based on the Gun
  HTTP/HTTP2/Websocket Erlang library.

  Glock aims to simplify the specific task of starting and configuring
  a websocket client connection to a remote server, providing common
  default values for all connection settings provided by Gun while still
  allowing for full customization.

  Glock also provides a set of callbacks for processing messages sent
  to and received from the remote server and tracking state across the
  life of the connection in whatever way makes sense to your application.
  Default callback implementations let you get up and running immediately
  for simply sending messages to a server and logging received responses
  by implementing the `__using__/1` macro:

  ### Example

      defmodule MySocket do
        use Glock.Socket
      end

      iex> {:ok, conn} = MySocket.start_link(host: "echo.websocket.org", path: "/")
      {:ok, #PID<0.260.0>}
      iex> :ok = MySocket.push(conn, "hello socket!")
      :ok

  Implementing the `init_stream/1` callback allows you to create and store
  state for the socket connection which can be accessed from subsequent message
  send or receive events. A simple example might be to count the number of
  messages sent and received from the socket.

  ### Example

      defmodule MySocket do
        use Glock.Socket

        def init_stream(conn: conn, protocols: _, headers: _) do
          %{
            "connection" => conn.stream,
            "sent" => 0,
            "received" => 0
          }
        end
      end

  Implementing the `handle_send/2` callback allows for customization of the
  message frame types and the encoding or serialization performed on messages
  prior to sending. Piggy-backing the prior example, a complex data structure
  could be serialized to JSON and counted before being sent to the remote server.

  ### Example

      defmodule MySocket do
      ...

        def handle_send(message, state) do
          frame = {:text, JSON.encode(message)}
          new_state = Map.put(state, "sent", state["sent"] + 1)
          {frame, new_state}
        end
      end

  Finally, implementing the `handle_receive/2` callback allows for custom
  handling of messages beyond simply logging them. All messages received
  by the gun connection pass through the `handle_receive/2` callback, so you
  can decode them, store them, reprocess them or anything else you like.
  This handler also covers receiving `:close` control frames and cleaning up/
  shutting down the glock process appropriately according to the Websocket
  specification.

  ### Example

      defmodule MySocket do
      ...

        def handle_receive(frame, state) do
          case frame do
            {:text, message} ->
              send_to_internal_queue(message)
              new_state = Map.put(state, "received", state["received"] + 1)
              {:doesnt_matter, {:ok, new_state}}
            :close ->
              JSON.encode(state) |> write_to_log_service()
              {:close, {:close, state}}
            _ ->
              {:doesnt_matter, {:ok, state}}
          end
        end
      end
